# Reflections

##1.1 Think About Time
I chose to research how small, habitual, behavioral changes can result in long-term, behavioral changes and change in attitude. Through my research, I continually saw examples of how making small tweaks, or how getting into a repetitive habit can result in an increase in productivity and improve attitude and confidence. One of my favorite examples came from this [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en#t-1232164) It's a 20 min video so I'll summarize it: Feelings of power and confidence are strongly associated with an large and open posture. The premise is that if you have trouble displaying these feelings you can "fake it" by displaying this large posture before a stressful situation like a job interview and you will actually perform better in that situation. Additionally, if you continually make this a habit, you will eventually automatically display power and confidence and actually BECOME that type of person.

This applies to Time Boxing in that Time Boxing sets yourself up for success by making yourself produce in small, doable steps by allocating a set time for the task at hand. I believe I'm already employing Time Boxing during Phase 0 when writing this reflection. I set aside some time to complete a few of the Week 1 tasks before I have go out and do necessary errands. Then I plan to set aside some time to continue working on Week 1 after completing my errands. Time Boxing allows me to attack a large set of work by breaking it down into small, doable pieces.

When working full time, I did not have many time limitations to complete work. I could go at my own pace even though I had deadlines. I did, however, use a form of Time Boxing by saying to myself, "I want to x, y and z done by 12:00 today" and set an internal goal. This did not always go according to plan, but it got me into the habit of staying on a continually moving path. Also, I would "reward" myself with taking lunch as long as I got what I wanted to done beforehand. I plan to work the same way during Phase 0 as I've had success past. If I recognize myself going to far astray or not allocating enough time to challenges and projects, I plan to employ the "small habitual changes lead to long term behavioral changes" method to get back on track. Though I do recognize my own vision can be limited, I plan to ask others about their strategies and see if I can incorporate their ideas. So I look forward to reading others' reflections.

I know I ran a little long in this reflection, but writing out all of my thoughts helps me better prepare for the exciting journey ahead. Thank you.

##1.2 The Command Line
A shell is an interface with the operating system. It controls input and output of the computer. Bash is a type of shell that uses a "command line" to directly input instructions to the computer's processor via text commands. The computer will then display a printed output below the inputted command.

I found it challenging to use the Windows Powershell because most of my expericence has been with Unix and most instructions are geared toward Unix systems, but I expect it is important to have knowledge of both command line types.
Practicing using the commands helped me understand how to use them all and I believe I have a solid mastery of them. I believe "help" is the most important command to know, because it can help you understand a new command that you don't understand or haven't used.

The commands definitions:

pwd shows the path (computer address) of present working directory--the directory that you are currently working in.

ls shows the files and directories in the present. In the Windows Powershell, it also displays information about them

mv moves a file to another directory or renames them if you don't move them to another directory. it can also rename directories

cd changes the directory you are working in

../ is a relative address that moves the directory you are working in "back" one step

touch only exists on Unix. It creates a new file. On Windows, you can use New-Item to create a new file
mkdir creates a new directory you can name

less displays the contents of a file. In Windows this command is "more"

rmdir deletes a specified directory

rm deletes a specified file or directory

help displays a series of instructions and guides on a specified command

##1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Repositories
The GitHub interface makes it very easy to create a new repository and to fork it. I would suggest to a user that all it takes is finding the write GUI button to do so. It's very intuitive. Cloning a repository from a remote repository into a local one is a bit more in depth. You have to make sure you have git installed on your machine. Then you need to locate the URL of the repository you want to clone. In the command line, once you are navigated to the directory you wish to clone the repository into, enter the command "git clone [URL]" 

The benefit of forking a repository is so that you can make changes to a file that don't affect the "master." After changes are made, you can merge them, if you wish. This is good for open source projects.

I did not have many struggles setting up git or GitHub. I once got ahead of myself and typed the incorrect command when cloning. I typed just "clone [URL]" instead of "git clone [URL]." Practicing the git commands taught me how its syntax works.
