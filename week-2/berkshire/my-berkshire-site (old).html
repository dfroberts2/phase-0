- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Writing and especially testing the HTML code into 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	The header, footer and section elements were helpful in organizing the Berkshire website and will make it easier when adding formatting to the page. Research was not difficult.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We followed the proper indentation conventions and created divs and spans (though we aimed to mainly use HTML5 elements) where appropriate so that we could later format the site in CSS.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	HTML is good because it makes it easy to structure the skeleton of a webpage. This makes the organization of the page clear. Sometimes tag syntax varies and it can be challenging to remember which tags close themselves.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I always close my tags when I create them and will then sandwich content between the tags. This helps me from forgetting to close the tags
