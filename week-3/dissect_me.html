<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
We used the header, nav, and section tags and I find that these ones are universal for most webpages.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Unless you style them, elements get laid out from top to bottom.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned how Sublime has built in templates called snippets. They appear handy, but we had some difficult creating them.
