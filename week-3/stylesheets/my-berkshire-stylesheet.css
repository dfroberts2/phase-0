/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is important to know the address of the sheet relative to the HTML document

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
In order to get the two columns of lists to position properly, we needed to use the float property. We hit a few walls, but having a good knowledge of the padding and margin properties helps organize things properly.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used the "font-size" "color" "text-align"  to modify the element style.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We added some classes to our HTML in order to help with the positioning and different font sizes.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
It is easier to read the code when there is a separate document for styling and content. The original Berkshire website had the styling built into the HTML which made it tougher to read sometimes.
