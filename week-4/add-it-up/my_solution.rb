# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: array of numbers
# Output: sum
# Steps to solve the problem.

# while the ith element of the array is not nil
#	sum = the ith element of the array
#	i = i + 1
#	sum = the ith element of the array + sum


# 1. total initial solution
def total(a)
	sum = 0
	i=0
	while a[i] != nil
		sum=a[i]+sum
		i=i+1
	end
	return sum
end



# 3. total refactored solution
