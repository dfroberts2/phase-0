# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I used the sort_by method. This sorts an array or hash (or any enumerable) according to a specified block.
#In the first example, if all the values in the example array were converted to strings and sorted they would be in the right order. This is because numbers as strings have higher priority over capitalized strings, which have higher priority over lower case strings. For this reason I set my sort_by block to sort the array items(denoted as "word") AS IF they were strings, without actually modifying them (done by writing "word.to_s" in the codeblock.
#In the second example, I wanted to sort a hash by it's values (the ages). I did this by specifiying that the keys were called "pet" in the code block and the values were called "age." Then in the code block, I sorted by age.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
