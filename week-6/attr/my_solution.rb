Release 1:
What are these methods doing?
initialize is setting the instance variables age, name and occupation to specific values. print_info can be called to print these three instance variables. what_is_age what_is_name and what_is_occupation print only the age, name and occupation respectively. change_my_age change_my_name and change_my_occupation set the instance variable to new inputted local variables.
How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
