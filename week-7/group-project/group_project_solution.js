// I want a program that takes a group of numbers and sums them all up
// I also want a program that takes that group of numbers and calculates their average
// Additionally, I want a program that finds the middle number of a group of numbers if they are ordered from least to greatest (aka the median)
// I want these programs to be able to work if I have an odd amount of numbers or an even amount
